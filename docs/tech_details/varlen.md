# Varlen Encoding

Many trace events feature large fields that often contain only a very small value. For example,
all interrupt-related events feature a 32-bit interrupt ID, but most microcontrollers will
at most have a few hundred interrupts. This would mean that most bytes of most numeric
fields are zero most of the time, wasting trace storage capacity or transfer bandwidth.

To combat this, TonbandgerÃ¤t uses the same specific form of variable-length (varlen) encoding that
is also by UTF-8 for most numeric values:

> Values are split into 7-bit septets, and are encoding starting with the least significant
> septet. Each septet is encoded as an 8-bit value, consisting of the septet in the lower bits,
> and a control bit in the most significant bit position that is set to `1` if there are more
> septets to follow, or `0` if this is the last septet and all following bits should be assumed
> to be zero.


For example, consider the 32-bit value `0x5`. With the scheme above, it is encoded as a single
byte:

```test
        +---> First 7 bits
     ___|___
    00000101
    |
    +--> No more bits to follow.
```

The value `0xFF` requires more than seven bits and therefor is split into two bytes:

```test
        +---> First 7 bits          +---> Next 7 bits
     ___|___                     ___|___
    11111111                    00000001
    |                           |
    +--> More bits to follow.   +--> No more bits to follow.
```

This system trades a much improved average message length for a longer worst-case 
message size.
