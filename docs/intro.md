A small embedded systems tracer with support for bare-metal and FreeRTOS-based targets.

## Overview
Tonbandgerät's [core](https://github.com/schilkp/Tonbandgeraet/tree/main/tband) is a small, portable, trace event generator
and handler written in C and designed for embedded systems. It requires minimal [porting](./porting.md) and [configuration](./config.md),
and features multiple [backends](./handling.md) for gathering and transmitting traces.

It can be used both with an RTOS or in bare-metal environments to [instrument user code](./evtmarkers.md) and track hardware events by tracing [interrupts](./interrupts.md).
Full tracing of [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/index.html) tasks and resources is also supported out-of-the box.

Tonbandgerät is based on a simple custom [binary trace format](./bin_format.md) designed to be fairly fast to encode and keep traces as small as possible. Recorded
traces can be viewed in Google's in-browser [perfetto](https://perfetto.dev) after conversion with the provided [CLI](./tband_cli.md) tool
or in-browser [converter](./web.md).

## Status

> 🚧 Note
> 
> Tonbandgerät is in early development and by no means considered stable. Everything - including the
> binary trace format - is subject to change.
> 
> Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/schilkp/Tonbandgeraet/issues).

### Completed:

#### Tonbandgerät:
- Trace encoder.
- Streaming backend.
- Snapshot backend.
- Metadata buffer.
- Initial FreeRTOS support.

#### Conversion tools:
- CLI converter.
- In-browser converter.

#### Other:
- STM32 + FreeRTOS example project.

### Work-In-Progress:

#### Tonbandgerät:

- Support for multicore tracing, including FreeRTOS SMP:
  Implemented and theoretically (almost?) done, but completely untested. Currently this
  is limited to cores that share a single, monotonic, time stamp timer.

- Full FreeRTOS support, including some PRs: PRs are in a draft state/being
  reviewd. Certain FreeRTOS (rare) are not yet traced correctly due to insufficient
  tracing hooks. Tracing of streambuffers, direct-to-task notification, timers, and
  event groups are not yet Implemented.


#### Other:
- This documentation.

### Planned:

#### Tonbandgerät:
- Post-mortem backend.
- Task stack utilization tracing.
- Multi-core for cores without common timebase.

#### Other:
- More examples, including a bare-metal project, RTT-backed project, and
  RP2040 SMP project.
- More example ports.

## Ideas:

#### Support Other RTOSes:
- All FreeRTOS-specific functionality has already been seperated into its own "module", and more RTOSes
  could be added as separate modules.

#### Custom UI:
- Perfetto, while incredibly powerful and simple to target, is not a perfect match for Tonbandgerät.
  It cannot display arbitrary tracks, forcing them to be global or part of a process/thread hierarchy.
  This could be improved by generating synthetic linux ftrace events, but that is a can of worms I don't
  quite want to open. Furthermore, as it stands at the time of writing, a perfetto-based trace will never
  be able to display trace events in real time.

- A custom UI would enable real-time viewing an be the first step towards a more "integrated" desktop tool that
  could also handle trace recording (building on [probe.rs](https://probe.rs/) for RTT communication). A gui
  built on [tauri](https://tauri.app/) and/or [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) could continue to enable
  the current in-browser experience.

- This would require a better in-memory model of trace data. Likely something like an in-memory DB? Apache Arrow?
