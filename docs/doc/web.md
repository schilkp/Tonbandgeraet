# Web Trace Converter

The web converter can be found at: 

[https://schilk.co/Tonbandgeraet/](https://schilk.co/Tonbandgeraet/)


## Overview
Traces can be added via file upload, or pasted as a hex/base64 string. Single-file traces can be uploaded, converted, and opened using the `1-CLICK-CONVERT` button.
For multi-file traces, upload and add all traces, then press `CONVERT`, followed by `OPEN` to open the trace in perfetto or `DOWNLOAD` to download the perfetto-ready trace.

```admonish note
The first time you use the web converter to redirect to perfetto, you will get a popup asking if you 
trust `schilk.co`. If you do trust me, the trace will open. If you don't, you will manually have to download
the trace from the converter and upload it to perfetto.
